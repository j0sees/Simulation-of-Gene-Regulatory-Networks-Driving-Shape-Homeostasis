## 📌 Overview

This software allows the **simulation and classification of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)** that drive **shape homeostasis** in multicellular systems — a key emergent phenomenon in developmental biology and artificial life.

The simulation is entirely written in **Python** and is based on the framework proposed by **Gerlee et al.** in the study _“The influence of cellular characteristics on the evolution of shape homeostasis”_, supported by several foundational models in the field of artificial life cited in the thesis.

## 🎯 Purpose

- To simulate multicellular collectives and observe adaptive behavior under dynamic environments.
- To classify GRNs that can maintain **shape homeostasis** in different environmental conditions.
- To explore the role of **growth factors**, **cell–cell interactions**, and **internal cellular actions** in emergent behavior.
- To demonstrate that **three major behavioral classes** lead to shape homeostasis.
- To showcase cellular responses as a function of different environmental types.

## 🧪 Methods and Technologies

This software combines a range of well-established computational techniques:

- 🔲 **Cellular Automata** — for modeling spatial environments and local cell dynamics.
- 🧠 **Artificial Neural Networks** — to implement gene regulatory networks within each cell.
- 🔍 **Optimization Algorithms** — to evolve adaptive networks and collective behavior.

These components interact to simulate the dynamics of cellular collectives, where behavior arises from:

- A dynamic equilibrium of cellular actions,
- The interaction between two growth factors enabling communication,
- And a signaling network acting as a **gene regulatory network**.
