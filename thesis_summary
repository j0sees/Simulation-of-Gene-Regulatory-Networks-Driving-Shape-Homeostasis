The main goal of the master thesis project is to expand the work made by Gerlee et al. (missing/fix reference). 

They implemented a computational model of developing cells on a grid.
Their aim was to study how different 
individual cellular characteristics drive the emergence of homeostatic structures. The model combines 
different sets of habilities for the cells such as: sense of orientation (polarisation) and comunication with 
surrounding neighbours via difusible factors.
Each cell has four possible states, namely: quiet, move, die, split. The selection of a state is 
made by a neural network which takes input values from the grid/environment. The outputs of the neural network give the cells a state, the amount 
of chemicals they produce and an orientation in the grid. Every individual cell contains a neural network which is inherited by his mother 
cell, this is the cell genotype. To reach the expected solutions, i.e., the homeostatic structure, an 
evolutionary algorithm optimises the neural network.
The following improvements to the initial model are to be made: 
	- Optimizing and increasing performance of the algorithms
	- Relaxing some of the model constraints, as the grid borders or the cell genotype. 
	- The improved model can be used to explore a larger solution space for the EA.
Expected results include the identification of minimal sets of characteristics that lead to different cellular 
behaviuor, recognition of distinct fitness functions that favour specific physical shapes, implementation of 
different models of cell dynamics: sets of rules, dynamical systems.
